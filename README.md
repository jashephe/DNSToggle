# DNSToggle

DNSToggle is a macOS menubar utility for quickly switching DNS resolvers. DNSToggle can be used to override the current manually-configured or default (DHCP-derived) resolvers. This may be useful on networks that employ DNS-level filtering (e.g. ad-blocking) for the purposes of temporarily disabling filtering (e.g. to access a website that would otherwise be ad-blocked). DNSToggle only alters the DNS configuration in System Settings; it does not actually alter the DNS transport path, so if your network or firewall intercept and rewrite DNS packets, this tool will not help.

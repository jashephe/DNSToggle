# DNSToggle

DNSToggle is a macOS menubar utility for quickly switching DNS resolvers. DNSToggle can be used to override the current manually-configured or default (DHCP-derived) resolvers. This may be useful on networks that employ DNS-level filtering (e.g. ad-blocking) for the purposes of temporarily disabling filtering (e.g. to access a website that would otherwise be ad-blocked). DNSToggle only alters the DNS configuration in System Settings; it does not actually alter the DNS transport path, so if your network or firewall intercept and rewrite DNS packets, this tool will not help.

generating and printing labels on ZPL-compatible thermal printers. You can define label templates with predefined *fields*, which can are then filled in with tabular data from a file or the clipboard (e.g. from a spreadsheet). LabelTool can communicate with label printers that understand the common ZPL II protocol, and print multiple labels with a single click.
